=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use RRDs; # see RRDtool documentation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This distribution installs F<RRDs.pm> on perls.
The RRDtool package will install RRDs.pm to the system perl, but there're cases
we need to install it to perls installded by ourselves.

NOTES: This distribution doesn't install rrdtool itself yet, as
other Alien::* dists do, but it does so in a future.

    pkg-config
    gettext
    glib
    xml2
    pango
    cairo
    XQuartz (for MacOSX)

Some of them might be installed by default.

Second, you can install this distribution by C<cpanm>:

    cpanm Alien::RRDtool

Then, you can use the C<RRDs> module.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

Perl 5.8.1 or later.

RRDtool depends on pkg-config, gettext, glib, xml2, pango and  cairo.
You shuould install those libraries by yourself with a package manager.

=head1 BUGS
